# Example file for initial netmagis database creation:
#	Views and group permissions for these views
# This example shows how to use Netmagis "without" views: all data
# are in the "default" view, and all groups must have access to this
# default view.
#
# Use with netmagis-dbimport:
#	netmagis-dbimport view view.txt
#
# Format:
#	<viewname> ALLBUT|SET <prio> <group> ... <group>
# ALLBUT : view authorized for all groups except those specified (may be emtpy)
# SET : view authorized for all specified groups
#
# Notes:
# - groups must already exist in database
# - views may or may not already exist in database
#

This directory contains example data to load into a fresh Netmagis
installation. There are two main objectives:
    - show how to import your own data
    - quickly get a running Netmagis installation in order to
	test the software
Data are loaded through the "run-all.sh" script which you can copy
and adapt to suit your own needs. See installation documentation
on http://netmagis.org

Furthermore, these data are used during the development stages to
test the software.

This document explains the scenario used in this example.

- The main company (Example Corporation) is organized as (see
    networks.txt):
    - a marketing departement
    - an IT departement
    - a R&D departement
    - a first plant, located on the main site
    - a second plant, located on another site
- recently, Example Corp has bought a subsidiary in a foreign country
    (domain .zz), which is not yet merged on a network point of
    view.
- Example Corp has organized a non commercial event, which needs a
    dedicated website (www.example.org)

- on an network management point of view, some users can use Netmagis
    (see networks.txt and group.txt):
    - network engineers (members of the wheel group) are allowed
	to administer the application itself, and have extended
	rights on all networks
    - network operators (members of the tech group) have access to
	all managed networks
    - operators from the marketing departement (members of the mktg
	group) are allowed to modify the marketing network only
    - operators from the plant 1 (members of the plant group) are
	allowed to modify the plant 1 network only
    - the subsidiary network is only managed by members of the
	subsid group (other people can not manage this network).

- on a DNS point of view (see domain.txt and zones/* files):
    - example.com holds all hosts, except those below
    - a delegated zone, plant1.example.com, holds all hosts from
	Plant 1. With Netmagis installation and ease of use, this
	subzone has been moved to the main DNS server since Plant
	1 operators have been convinced to shutdown their own DNS
	server.
    - a delegated zone, plant2.example.com, is still managed on
	another server by Plant 2 network operators.
    - other zones are example.org and subsid.co.zz, which are
	on the main DNS server.

- on a mail point of view (see mailrelay.txt and mailrole.txt):
    - all mail traffic is routed through mx[12].example.com
    - internal mail routing accepts mail to:
	sales.example.com
	mktg.example.com
	its.example.com
	sales.subsid.co.zz

- on a DHCP point of view
    - networks of Marketing, ITS, R&D and Plant 1 are DHCP enabled
    - Marketing network has 2 dynamic DHCP ranges 172.16.11.100-119 and 140-149
    - Plant 1 network has a dynamic DHCP range 172.16.15.1-99

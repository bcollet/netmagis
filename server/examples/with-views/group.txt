# Example file for initial netmagis database creation:
#	Groups
#
# Use with netmagis-dbimport:
#	netmagis-dbimport group group.txt
#
# Format:
#	<group> <login> ... <login>
#
# Notes:
# - proper auth (internal or LDAP) must already be configured
# - groups may or may not already exist in database
# - users may or may not already exist in database
#
# History:
#   2012/10/09 : pda : design of a multi-view example
#

# the following line is not really needed: the wheel group is created
# by default by netmagis-dbcreate with admin privileges, and members
# are initialized from the "rootusers" parameter in netmagis.conf.
# However, you can add new members which are not rootusers (they have
# admin privileges but cannot log when the application is in maintenance
# mode).
